# Hyperdrive: The Lost 1982 Text Adventure

## Introduction

This repository preserves a science-fiction text adventure titled "Hyperdrive."
It was originally written in 1982 by Ken Stone, building on earlier work he
and John Hardy had done together. That work began as a fantasy adventure called
`Caverns` on a Sinclair ZX81 with a 16K RAM expansion, then was ported
to the VIC-20 with a 16K expansion cartridge. 

`Hyperdrive` followed as a new science-fiction game, reusing ideas and structures
from that earlier codebase. Ken Stone advanced the work with new concepts and
systems that fit a spacefaring setting, bringing science-fiction themes into an
interactive fiction program. It built on what came before, but introduced a
different approach shaped by the sci-fi tone rather than the high-fantasy feel
of the earlier game.

For decades the program was considered lost. The only surviving copy lived on
an aging, damaged cassette tape. Sometime around 2019, the tape was transferred to a WAV
file, and that audio capture became the sole surviving artifact. Through a
careful recovery process, John Hardy reconstructed the original BASIC listing
with what appears to be 100% fidelity to the 1982 program.

## What the game is about?

You are the pilot of a small space yacht damaged in a freak accident. You dock
with a massive derelict cruiser to find what you need to survive and get home.
The wreck is moody and dangerous: dim corridors, cracked observation ports,
strange machinery, and unsettling signs of long-abandoned systems. Tension
builds as you navigate unfamiliar passages, manage dwindling resources, and
piece together what happened aboard.

Think of it as a classic 1980s sci-fi adventure: exploration-first, terse
commands, and a slow-burn atmosphere where every room description hints at
history you can’t quite see. The joy is in mapping the cruiser, learning its
rules, and uncovering just enough to make your next safe move.

This repo contains:

- `src/hyperdrive.bas`: the restored BASIC source listing
- `src/hyperdrive.wav`: the recovered cassette transfer

The goal here is preservation: keep the recovered source and audio together so
the story of Hyperdrive remains complete.

## Addendum

Later, John Hardy wrote a sequel titled `Hyperdrive II` for the Australian
Microbee computer. It is its own game, but it echoes some of the themes
established by the original VIC-20 `Hyperdrive`.
